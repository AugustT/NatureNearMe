# @NatureNearMe

@NatureNearMe is a project that aims to show how data from the NBN can be made available through Twitter. You can find out more here: http://naturenearme.weebly.com/

The code here will hopefully be enough for those familiar with R to see how things are done however not everything needed to make this programme work is present since I have remove things such as my login credentials for Twitter and the NBN Gateway
